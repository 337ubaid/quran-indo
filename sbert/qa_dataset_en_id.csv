The former replied, 'Surely, Allah only accepts the sacrifice of the righteous. If you stretch out your hand to kill me, I will not stretch out my hand to kill you. I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I want you to bear the sin of my killing, and the sin you have already committed, so that you will be among the inhabitants of the Fire.

The hypocrites, in truth, are neither of the Muslims nor of the Jews. They swear falsely that they are Muslims and that you are the messenger of Allah, while they know that they are lying in what they have sworn. Allah has prepared for these hypocrites a severe and painful punishment. Indeed, what they have been doing of hypocrisy and swearing falsely is evil. The hypocrites have taken their false oaths as a shield to protect themselves from being killed because of their disbelief and to prevent the Muslims from fighting them and taking their wealth. Because of this, they have turned away themselves and others from the path of Allah, which is Islam. For them is a humiliating punishment in the Fire; for their arrogance in not believing in Allah and His messenger and their turning away from His path. You will not be able to protect the hypocrites' wealth or their children from Allah's punishment. Those are the ones who will enter the Fire and dwell therein eternally. This retribution will encompass everyone who turns away from Allah's religion by his speech or his action. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring forth the hypocrites from their graves all together, alive. They will swear to Him that they were believers, as they used to swear to you, O you who believe, in the world. And they think that that will benefit them with Allah, as it used to benefit them in the world with the believers. Indeed, they are the most extreme in falsehood.

This was the first expulsion of its kind from the Arabian Peninsula to Syria, and later, during the caliphate of Omar, they were expelled to Khaybar. What did you think, O Muslims, that they would be expelled from their homes in such humiliation and disgrace? Despite their strength and power, they were expelled because of their disbelief and arrogance. The Jews thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah's power, but Allah afflicted them with fear and terror from an unexpected direction. They destroyed their own homes with their own hands and the hands of the believers. O you who have sound intellect and clear sight, take heed from what happened to them. If Allah had not decreed their expulsion from their homes, He would have punished them in this world with killing and captivity, and they would face the fire of Hell in the hereafter. This is what befell the Jews in this world and what awaits them in the hereafter because they disobeyed Allah and His messenger. O believers, whatever palm trees you cut down or leave standing, you do so with Allah's permission and command, so that those who disobey Him and defy His commands may be humiliated. This is what happened to the Jews when they prevented the cutting of the fruit-bearing trees, which they considered an act of destruction. Allah granted the spoils of war to His messenger from the Jews of Banu Nadir, but they did not ride horses or camels to collect them. Allah sends His messengers to whomever He wills among His enemies, and they surrender without a fight. The spoils of war are taken from the wealth of the disbelievers without a fight.

In His exalted knowledge, He equates those who conceal their words with those who speak them openly, and those who hide their deeds in the darkness of night with those who display them in broad daylight. God has angels who succeed one another in guarding man, both in front of him and behind him, by His command, recording all that he does, whether good or evil. God does not change the blessings He has bestowed upon a people until they change what He has commanded them, and when He wills a trial for a group, there is no averting it, and they have no protector besides Him to take charge of their affairs. He brings them the beloved and repels the hated. He shows you His signs, the lightning, which is a flash of light from the clouds, so you fear that it will bring you a bolt of burning lightning, and you hope that it will bring you rain, by His power He brings the laden clouds to you for your benefit. The thunder praises God with a praise that indicates its submission to its Lord, and the angels glorify their Lord in fear of Him, and God sends the destructive lightning that strikes whomever He wills of His creation. The disbelievers argue about God's oneness and His power over resurrection, but He is severe in punishment and powerful against the disobedient. To God alone belongs the call to unity (there is no god but God), so He is not worshipped nor invoked except Him. The deities they worship besides God do not answer the caller's invocation, and their situation is like that of a thirsty person who stretches out his hand to the water, but cannot reach it.

David ruled that the sheep should belong to the owner of the crop as compensation for the damage, with both sides being equal in value. We were witnesses to their judgment, which was not hidden from us. Solomon understood the need to consider the benefit of both parties while maintaining justice. He ruled that the owner of the sheep should repair the damaged crop within a period that would allow the owner of the crop to benefit from the sheep's milk, wool, and other such benefits.

When it became clear that it was absent, he said, 'I will surely punish this hoopoe with a severe punishment for its absence, either as a deterrent or as a sacrifice for what it has done, for neglecting what it was trained for, or it may bring a clear excuse for its absence.' The hoopoe stayed away for a short time, then it came back, and Solomon rebuked it for its absence and delay. The hoopoe said, 'I have learned something that you did not know, and I have come to you from the city of Sheba in Yemen with important news, and I am certain of it. I found a woman ruling the people of Sheba, and she has everything that this world has to offer, and she has a great throne on which she sits to manage her kingdom. I found her and her people worshipping the sun, turning away from worshipping Allah, and the devil has made their evil deeds seem good to them, and has turned them away from believing in Allah and worshipping Him alone. The devil has made that seem good to them, so that they do not worship Allah, who brings out the hidden and the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you whisper and what you say openly. Allah, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the Lord of the great throne.' Solomon said, 'We will consider the news you have brought us, whether you are truthful or one of the liars.

She said to them, 'A great book has reached me from a person of high standing.' She then explained its contents, saying, 'It is from Solomon, and it begins with 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not be arrogant, nor be proud of what I have called you to, and come to me in submission to Allah, as Muslims.' She said to her nobles, 'Adviseme in this matter, for I do not decide on any matter without your consultation.' They replied, 'We are strong in numbers and equipment, and brave in war. The matter is yours, and you are the one with the wisdom. So, tell us what you command, and we will obey you.' She warned them against facing Solomon with hostility and explained the futility of war, saying, 'Kings, when they enter a town, ravage it and make its nobles humble. This is their consistent way of instilling fear in people.' She sent a gift to Solomon and his people, and awaited the return of the messengers. When the queen's messenger arrived with the gift, Solomon said, 'Do you try to bribe me with money to please me? What Allah has given me in prophecy, kingship, and abundant wealth is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in the gift that is given to you, for you are proud of this world and boast about it.' Solomon said to the messenger of the people of Sheba, 'Go back to them, for by Allah, we will send them armies against which they will have no power to resist or confront. We will drive them out of their land in humiliation and disgrace, unless they submit to Allah's religion alone and abandon the worship of anything else.' Solomon asked, 'Which of you will bring me the throne of the queen before they come to me in submission?' A powerful and strong jinn said, 'I will bring it to you before you rise from your seat. I am strong enough to carry it, and I am trustworthy; I will bring it to you as it is, without diminishing or changing anything.' The one who had knowledge of the Book said, 'I will bring it to you before your eyelid drops.' Solomon gave him permission, and he invoked Allah and brought the throne. When Solomon saw it present before him, he said, 'This is from the favor of my Lord to test me: whether I will be grateful for this blessing or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful does so for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, my Lord is Independent, Most Generous. He bestows His bounty on whomever He wills, both in this world and the Hereafter.' Solomon said to those around him, 'Change the queen's throne into a different form when she sees it; let us see if she will recognize it or be one of those who do not recognize it.' When the queen of Sheba came to Solomon in his assembly, she was asked, 'Is this your throne?' She said, 'It is like it.' Solomon knew that she had recognized it and believed in Allah's power and Solomon's prophecy. He said, 'We have been given knowledge before it, and we were Muslims.' What prevented her from worshipping Allah alone was what she used to worship besides Him. She was from a people who were disbelievers. Although she had intelligence and understanding, false beliefs can mislead one's judgment. She was told, 'Enter the glass palace,' and when she saw it, she thought it was water, and she uncovered her legs to wade in it. Solomon said, 'It is a glass floor with water underneath.' She realized the greatness of Solomon's kingdom and said, 'Lord, I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.'|Entity|Story|Solomon|The People of Saba|The Story of the Queen of Sheba|Not|What is the story of Solomon (peace be upon him) with the Queen of Sheba?|The Ant|[29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44]|"Quran Surah 27 Ayah 29:

This event happened before Moses' prophethood. Moses said, 'Lord, I have wronged my soul by killing a person without being commanded to do so. Please forgive me for this sin.' God forgave him. God is indeed forgiving to the sins of His servants, merciful to them. Moses said, 'Lord, because of Your grace in granting me repentance, forgiveness, and many blessings, I will not be a helper to anyone who disobeys You or commits crimes.' The next morning, Moses was in Pharaoh's city, afraid and waiting for news about himself and the man he had killed.

They were unable to push their way forward with the men, and they waited until the men had watered their livestock before watering their own. When Moses saw this, he was moved with compassion for them and said, 'What is the matter with you?' They said, 'We cannot push our way forward with the men, and our father is an old man who cannot do this himself.' So Moses watered their livestock for them, then sat down in the shade of a tree and said, 'Lord, I am in need of whatever good You may send me.' He was very hungry. Then one of the women came to him, walking modestly, and said, 'My father invites you to accept payment for watering our livestock.' So Moses went with her to her father. When he arrived and told him the story of Pharaoh and his people, the old man said, 'Do not be afraid, you have escaped from the unjust people, and they are Pharaoh and his people. They have no power here.' One of the women said to her father, 'Father, hire him to tend your livestock; the best person to hire is the strong and trustworthy one who will not betray your trust.'

If you complete ten years, it will be a kindness from you, and I do not want to make it difficult for you by making it ten. You will find me, if God wills, among the righteous in good companionship and fulfilling my promises.' Moses said, 'That is agreed between you and me.

His people said to him, 'Do not be arrogant because of what you have been given. Indeed, Allah does not love the arrogant who are ungrateful.' Seek in what Allah has given you of wealth the reward of the Hereafter by doing righteous deeds in this world, and do not neglect your share of this world by indulging in it excessively, and do good to people with it, as Allah has done good to you with this abundant wealth. And do not seek what Allah has made forbidden for you by oppressing your people. Indeed, Allah does not love the corrupt.' Qarun said to his people who advised him, 'I was given this wealth because of my knowledge and power. Did Qarun not know that Allah had destroyed before him from the nations those who were stronger than him and had more wealth?' He went out to his people in his finery, wanting to show off his greatness and wealth. Those who desired the life of this world said, 'Would that we had what Qarun has been given of wealth, finery, and status! Indeed, Qarun has a great share of this world.' But those who had knowledge of Allah and His religion and understood the truth of the matter said to those who said that, 'Woe to you! Fear Allah and obey Him. The reward of Allah is better for one who believes and does righteous deeds than what Qarun has been given. And no one accepts this advice and is guided by it and acts upon it except one who struggles against his own self, endures in the obedience of his Lord, and avoids His disobedience.' So we caused the earth to swallow Qarun and his household. He had no army to help him besides Allah, and he was not of those who could save themselves.

Allah will reward the truthful for their truthfulness and righteousness, and the believers are they who are truthful. He will punish the hypocrites if He wills, either by not guiding them to sincere repentance before their death, causing them to die in disbelief and earn the fire, or by guiding them to repentance and sincere return to Him.

But if you are invited, enter, and when you have eaten, leave without lingering for a conversation that may displease the Prophet, as his patience and tolerance may be tried, and he may feel embarrassed to ask you to leave, although he has the right to do so. Allah does not shy away from revealing the truth. And when you ask the wives of the Prophet for something from the household items, ask them from behind a screen, for that is purer for your hearts and theirs, and it prevents the temptation of looking at each other in a way that is not appropriate. It is not right for you to cause harm to the Prophet, nor to marry his wives after his death, for they are your mothers, and it is not permissible for a man to marry his mother. The harm you may cause to the Prophet and the marriage of his wives after his death is a great sin.

And Muhammad (peace be upon him) complained to his Lord about his people who rejected him, saying, 'O Lord, indeed these are a people who do not believe in You and in what You have sent me with.' So forgive, O Messenger, their faults, and turn away from their harm. Do not expect anything from them but the greeting that the wise and the discerning send to the ignorant.

The crier replied, 'We have lost the king's measuring cup, and the reward for its return is a camel load of grain. I myself will guarantee the camel load.' The brothers said, 'Indeed, we have come to this land not to cause corruption, and it is not in our nature to be thieves.' The searchers asked the brothers, 'What is the punishment for theft in your land, if you are lying about not being thieves?' The brothers replied, 'The punishment for the thief whose stolen goods are found with him is that he must return them and become a slave to the one he stole from. This is how we punish those who commit theft, and this is our law and custom in such cases.' They returned to Joseph, and he himself searched their belongings, starting with their own and then with Benjamin's, to ensure that his plan to keep Benjamin with him would succeed. He finally reached Benjamin's sack, from which he took out the measuring cup. Thus, we made Joseph's plan successful in keeping his brother with him, and he would not have been able to take his brother as a slave according to the law of the Egyptian king. But God willed it this way and judged the matter according to the law of the brothers, which decreed that the thief should be enslaved.

So, Allah sent fire upon it at night while they were asleep, and it was burned and became black like the dark night. In the morning, they called out to each other: 'Go early to your garden, if you are determined to pluck its fruits.' They hurried, whispering to each other: 'Do not let any of the poor enter your garden today.' They went to their garden early in the morning, determined to prevent the poor from its fruits, thinking they had the power to do so. When they saw their garden burned, they denied it, saying: 'We have lost our way to it.' When they realized it was their garden, they said: 'Rather, we are deprived of its goodness because of our determination to be stingy and prevent the poor.' He said to them: 'Did I not tell you to say: 'Insha'Allah'? They said after they came to their senses: 'May Allah, our Lord, be free from injustice in what has befallen us, but we were unjust to ourselves by not saying 'Insha'Allah' and by our evil intention.' They turned to each other, blaming one another for not saying 'Insha'Allah' and for their evil intention. They said: 'Woe to us! We have been excessive in preventing the poor and disobeying Allah's command. We hope that our Lord will give us something better than our garden because of our repentance and admission of our sin. We are eager for our Lord alone, seeking forgiveness, asking for good.' Such is the punishment that befell the owners of the garden. It will be the punishment in this world for those who disobey Allah's command and are stingy with the blessings Allah has given them, without fulfilling Allah's right in them.

It is the shining, radiant star. Every soul has a guardian angel who preserves its deeds to be accounted for on the Day of Judgment. So, let the disbeliever in the resurrection consider from what he was created. Let him know that the resurrection of man is not harder than his first creation from a drop of semen, quickly placed in the womb, emerging from between the ribs of a man and the bones of a woman. Indeed, He who created man from this water is certainly able to return him to life after death. On that day, hearts will be tested and laid bare, and the righteous will be distinguished from the wicked. What strength does man have to defend himself, and what protector can he have against Allah's punishment? The sky has rain that repeats, and the earth has cracks through which vegetation grows. The Quran is a clear distinction between truth and falsehood, and it is not a joke. It is not permissible for a creature to swear by other than Allah, otherwise, he has associated partners with Him. Those who reject the Messenger, peace be upon him, and the Quran, plot and scheme to repel the truth and support falsehood. But I plot against them a plot, and I lead them astray, unaware, to show the truth, even if the disbelievers dislike it. O Messenger, do not hasten the punishment for them, but give them respite and watch them a little, and do not hasten it for them. You will see what will befall them of punishment, torment, and doom.|Description|Explanation|Verse|Tafsir|Verse|Interpret|And by the sky and the Night Visitor, and what do you know what the Night Visitor is?

Indeed, he is capable over its return. On the day when secrets are revealed. He will have no power or helper. And the sky, it has its return. And the earth, it splits open. Indeed, that is a decisive word. And it is not a trivial matter. Indeed, they are planning a plan. And I am planning a plan.
